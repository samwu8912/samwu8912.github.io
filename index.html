			<h1>What does the data say?</h1>
			<p>Below is a look into how the Asian American community has registered and voted for national elections over time. The dataset did not include respondents from before 1966. <br> The most active populations are: Indian, Southeast Asian, Japanese (includes Japanese Americans).</p>

			<p>A weakness of this dataset is the decision to group Southeast Asian respondents into a single group. This would include Philipinos, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, etc. and could be masking many of the differences between these communities. 
			<br>
			<p>Below is a look into the party of the presidential nominee that Asian Americans voted for.</p>

			<p>The ANES data includes a count of how many different ways did a respondent engage during a campaign. Engagement is categorized as the following behaviors during the campaign: try to influence others, attend political meetings/rallies, work for a party/candidate, display candidate button/sticker, donate money to the party or candidate.</p>
