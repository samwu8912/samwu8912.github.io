			<p>Unfortunately, party registration information in the ANES did not reveal much. Below is a look into the party of the presidential nominee that Asian Americans voted for. It is interesting to see the trends for those who voted but did not vote in the presidential race (7).</p>

			<p>The ANES data includes a count of how many different ways did a respondent engage during a campaign. Engagement is categorized as the following behaviors during the campaign: try to influence others, attend political meetings/rallies, work for a party/candidate, display candidate button/sticker, donate money to the party or candidate.</p>
