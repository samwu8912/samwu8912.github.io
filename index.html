			<h1>Why this data?</h1>
			<p>The Asian voting block is not monolithic. I chose this dataset to dive into how do various Asian ethnicities participate in the political system.<br>Within the community, we often hear about how inactive the community is or, for those who do participate, conservative the vote tends to be. I wanted to see if this was true and if it had changed over time.</p>

			<h1>What does the data say?</h1>
			<p>Below is a look into how the Asian American community has registered and voted for national elections over time. The dataset did not include respondents from before 1966. <br> The most active populations are: Indian, Southeast Asian, Japanese (includes Japanese Americans).</p>

			<p>A weakness of this dataset is the decision to group Southeast Asian respondents into a single group. This would include Philipinos, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, etc. and could be masking many of the differences between these communities. 
			<br>
			<p>Below is a look into the party of the presidential nominee that Asian Americans voted for. There's an interesting trend for Chinese respondents not voting in the presidential race. The Southeast Asian vote proportion peaked for Republicans in 1996.</p>

			<p>The ANES data includes a count of how many different ways did a respondent engage during a campaign. Engagement is categorized as the following behaviors during the campaign: try to influence others, attend political meetings/rallies, work for a party/candidate, display candidate button/sticker, donate money to the party or candidate.</p>
